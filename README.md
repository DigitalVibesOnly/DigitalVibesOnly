## Yvonne Ile – @DigitalVibesOnly

Peace &' Blessings 🌻 I'm Yvonne 🙋🏿‍♀️ I made the decision to get into Tech earlier this year and completed an SE Bootcamp. Now, with an understanding of Python, I'm looking to pivot into UI/UX because BABY – the outside and inside need to match!😛 I'm an Artist – currently a DPhil Music Student at the University of Oxford #MakingHistory ✊🏿 so _talk to me niiice_!

## My Values

🤸🏿‍♀️ Expression As Authentic Self
💕 Transparency, Honesty and Trust
💡 Experimentation and Curiosity

## My Skills

- Software Development in Python 🐍
- Object Oriented Programming 👩🏿‍💻
- Version Control 🆚
- Graphic and Interface Design 🎨

## How I Work

I am motivated to provide clarity _through_ curiosity and that tends to manifest as creating some semblance of a process; I am the biggest fan of lists ✅ I love to work independently and remotely but I'm very here for collaboration because it takes a village! 😩🙌🏿 

## Are You Curious?

🌱 I am very open to mentoring and support so feel free to nudge me!
